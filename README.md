# Seattle Restaurant GeoNarrative

## Project Description
This project is an interactive GeoNarrative that visualizes my favorite restaurants in Seattle, focusing on **Thai and Italian cuisines**. The narrative consists of five scroll-triggered scenes:  

1. **All Restaurants** – displays all Thai, Italian, and fusion restaurants in Seattle.  
2. **Thai Restaurants** – filters to show only Thai restaurants.  
3. **Italian Restaurants** – filters to show only Italian restaurants.  
4. **Kin Len Thai Night Bites** – highlights my favorite Thai restaurant in Fremont.  
5. **Dué Cucina** – highlights my favorite Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill.  
6. **Closing Scene** – reflects back on the two favorite restaurants, resetting the background map to show all restaurants.

The map changes dynamically as the user scrolls, including **different map angles, 3D perspectives, and zoom levels** to make the storytelling more engaging. The last two scenes also switch to a **satellite map style** to differentiate them visually from the first three scenes, and scrolling back up reverts the map to the original light style. A **legend** was added to explain point colors: red for Thai, blue for Italian, and gray for fusion cuisines (Thai+other or Italian+other in one restaurant but the filters only show solely Thai or Italian no fusion).

## Data Sources
- **Restaurant Data:** Extracted using **Overpass Turbo** from OpenStreetMap. The dataset includes restaurant names, addresses, cuisine types, and geographic coordinates.  
- **Geospatial Context:** Seattle city coordinates were used to center the map, and Mapbox layers were applied for visual styling and interactivity.  
- **Additional Multimedia:** Images for the cover page and closing page, icons for the legend, and overlay text were incorporated to enhance the narrative experience and taken from the restaurant's websites themselves.

## Features & Project Requirements Addressed
- **Use of Multiple Geospatial Datasets:** The project integrates restaurant data from Overpass Turbo (OSM) along with Mapbox base maps.  
- **Map Transitions:** At least two different Mapbox styles are used — `light-v10` for the first three scenes and `satellite-streets-v11` for the last two. Scroll-triggered transitions adjust the zoom, pitch, and bearing of the map.  
- **Multimedia Integration:** The project uses images for the cover page, a closing page image, a legend with icons, and text overlays.  
- **Accessible Repository:** Map Url:
  https://jishnuk123.github.io/GeoNarrative-Lab/index.html 
  You can view the live interactive map at the same URL.

## AI Disclosure
AI assistance was used to debug the transitions between scenes, ensuring that the map updates correctly when scrolling both down and back up. This involved refining the Scrollama enter and exit event handlers so that filters, zoom levels, map angles, and style changes are applied correctly for each scene. No content, data analysis, or creative text was generated by AI and it was strictly used to troubleshoot and optimize the interactive map behavior.
